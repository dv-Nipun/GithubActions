# Hello World GitHub Actions

This repository contains a basic GitHub Actions workflow named "Hello World" that prints "Hello World!" to the console whenever there is a push event on the repository.

## Workflow Details

The workflow is triggered by the following event:

- Push event: The workflow runs whenever new code changes are pushed to the repository.

The workflow consists of one job named "my-job", which has the following configuration:

- Runs on: `ubuntu-latest` runner.
- Steps: There is a single step named "my-step" that executes the command to print "Hello World!".

## How it Works

When a push event occurs, GitHub Actions automatically executes the defined workflow. The "my-job" job runs on the `ubuntu-latest` runner, and the "my-step" step executes the command to print "Hello World!" to the console.

## Usage

You can use this workflow as a starting point for your GitHub Actions setup. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Modify the `run` command in the "my-step" step to perform your desired actions.
3. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.

Now, every time you push changes to your repository, the workflow will be triggered, and your custom actions will be executed.
